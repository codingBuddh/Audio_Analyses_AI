       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'KyBgxe-rU48'}, page_content='- [Narrator] You\\'re walking on the street and suddenly you find a piece of gold, you pick it up and you get super curious. You have a lot of questions in your mind. One of the questions is, what happens if you were to break it? I mean, surely you can\\'t\\nbreak it with your own hands but hey, when has that stopped you from imagining things, right? So what happens if you break this? Well, you get two pieces of\\ngold and then you wonder, well, what if you break it even further? You get even more smaller pieces. And what if you break it even further? We get even more smaller pieces. And now you start wondering,\\n\"Hey, can I keep doing that?\" Can I keep breaking this\\npiece of gold forever? That\\'s what we we\\'re gonna\\ntalk about in this video. This was a question that many ancient philosophers\\nfrom India, Greece, Roman, probably many more, pondered upon. They wondered, if you take any element, remember what elements are? These are roughly about\\n100 building blocks that make up all the\\nmatter in the universe gold is an example of them. So they wondered, if you take any element, could you keep breaking them down forever? And a lot of them thought,\\nthat maybe the answer is no. Maybe you can\\'t keep breaking it forever. Maybe eventually, you will get one last smallest piece of that element, a smallest piece of gold, for example, which you cannot break any further. A lot of people believed in this idea, and the Greeks actually named\\nthis smallest piece, the atom. The word atom literally means uncuttable because they believe that you\\ncannot break this even more. Now, for a long time, many people didn\\'t believe in this idea. So for centuries, the idea\\nof atom was suppressed until it was revived back by\\nscientists like John Dalton. And today we have plenty of\\nevidence that they do exist. So, what exactly are atoms? Well, think of atoms as the\\nsmallest piece of an element that has all the\\nproperties of that element. It is literally the building\\nblock of the element itself. For example, what\\'s a gold atom? Gold atoms are the\\nsmallest pieces of gold, which has all the properties of gold. They\\'re the building blocks of gold. What\\'s a carbon atom? Well, they are the\\nsmallest pieces of carbon They\\'re the building blocks of carbon. They have all the properties of carbon. And just to give you another\\nexample, what\\'s mercury atom? They\\'re the smallest pieces of mercury. They have all the properties\\nof the element mercury and so on and so forth. Now, one question you could be having is, do atoms look like tiny balls? And the answer is no, it\\'s\\njust a representation. In reality, atoms are so incredibly tiny, we can\\'t even see them with microscopes. So how tiny are they you ask? Well, their size is\\nincredibly hard to comprehend. So here\\'s a way to think\\nabout it, how many gold atoms do you think you will find\\nin a typical gold ring? Well, it\\'s not millions, not\\nbillions, it\\'s sextillions that\\'s one followed by 21 zeros, that many atoms you\\'ll\\nprobably find in a gold ring. And just to get a sense of this number scientists estimate that\\nthat is roughly about the total number of stars\\nin the observable universe. Let that sink in. That\\'s\\nhow small atoms are. So long story short, almost\\nall the matter in the universe, from the microbes to dogs and cats, to mountains to planets and stars, and almost everything that\\nyou see in this universe, they\\'re all fundamentally\\nmade of elements. These are the building blocks of all the matter in the universe. We have about 100 of them. But what are elements\\nfundamentally made of? Elements like gold or any\\nother element for that matter they are fundamentally made of atoms. They are the smallest\\npieces of the elements, the building blocks of the elements that contain all the\\nproperties of that element.')]"
